# Langton's Ant (Hexagon)

Implementation of Langton's ant on a hexagonal grid.
The instructions for the ant are randomized periodically, or when the ant leaves the screen.

The notation used is a bit different from other notations.
The numbers correspond to the number of clockwise rotations to perform.
Thus 0 is N, 1 is R1, 2 is R2, 3 is U, 4 is L2, and 5 is L1.
